"""ffmpeg transcode presets for HDHomeRun `server_transcode` playback.

Turning the tuner's raw MPEG-2 stream into browser-playable H.264/AAC needs
`ffmpeg`, and the fastest way to do that depends entirely on what hardware
the *backend* happens to run on — a software encode that's fine on a
desktop CPU can pin a Raspberry Pi, a hardware encoder that's free on one
box (Intel Quick Sync) doesn't exist on another (Apple Silicon, a plain ARM
SBC), and there's no single "auto-detect" ffmpeg build/driver setup that
covers all of them. The presets below cover the combinations this project
is actually deployed on or tested against; "custom" is the escape hatch for
anything else (a different GPU, a tuned bitrate, etc).

Each preset splits into `input_args` (placed before `-i`, needed for
hwaccel decode setup) and `output_args` (placed after it, before the fixed
`-f mpegts pipe:1` framing that the /stream route always appends — the
container and transport are structural, not something a preset should be
able to change).

Any `{device}` in either list is substituted with the widget's
`hwaccel_device` setting at build time. The render node isn't always
`/dev/dri/renderD128` — a second DRM device (a discrete GPU, or a
`simpledrm`/`vkms` node claiming card0) shifts the iGPU's node to
`renderD129`, which used to be unreachable without dropping to the "custom"
preset. `app/hwaccel.py` enumerates what's actually present.
